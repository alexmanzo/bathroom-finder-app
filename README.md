<h1>All-Gender Bathroom Finder</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This project stems from a drive to fulfill a personal need, and a need for many other non-binary and trans identifying individuals. When on any given day you can be perceived as either male or female, something as simple as going to the bathroom can become a huge safety issue. My spouse and I try to frequent locations that offer gender-netural bathrooms, but it can be hard remembering all of those spaces.</p>
<p>This project seeks to fulfill that need by providing a database of locaitons with all-gender bathrooms that anyone can add to. Its present functionality allows for the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Returns a list of safe bathrooms based on the user's present location. (Note: all locations currently are on the Triangle area of North Carolina.</li>
  <li>Users can search for locations with the Google Places API generating autocomplete results for teh search engine.</li>
  <li>Users can add new locations</li>
</ul>
<p>Plans for future funtionality include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a link to a location's website</li>
  <li>Create a Map view in addition to List view of search results.</li>
  <li>Add authentication to allow for users to create an account</li>
  <li>Require users to answer a series of questions about a location before adding it.</li>
  <li>Allow users to add comments about a location.</li>
  <li>Allow users to edit or delete a location</li>
  <li>Create an admin account to handle user feedback & requests</li>
</ul>
